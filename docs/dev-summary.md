# Development Summary - PyBulkPDF

This document summarizes the development process for the PyBulkPDF command-line tool.

*Initial summary based on conversations around April 15, 2025.*
*Refactoring summary added April 16, 2025.*

## 1. Project Initialization

* **Input:** Reviewed the project requirements outlined in `PyBulkPDF/docs/project-description.md`.
* **Goal:** Create a Python CLI tool to perform mail-merge operations on PDF forms using data from a spreadsheet, as an alternative to Windows-only solutions. Core library identified as `pypdf`.

## 2. Environment Setup

* Established steps for setting up a Python 3 virtual environment (`venv`).
* Installed initial dependencies (`pypdf`, `openpyxl`, `colorama`, `tqdm`) via `requirements.txt`.

## 3. Initial CLI Structure & Logic (Script-based)

* Developed the basic script (`pybulkpdf.py`) using `argparse` for arguments.
* Defined two primary modes: `generate-template` and `fill-form`.
* Implemented basic logging, file checks, and directory preparation.
* Implemented `generate_template_files` using `pypdf` and `openpyxl` (initially CSV, then switched to Excel with Table formatting).
* Implemented `fill_pdf_forms` using `pypdf` and `openpyxl`.
* Added enhancements like colored logging (`colorama`), progress bars (`tqdm`), and an overwrite flag.
* Addressed bugs related to `PdfWriter` cloning and keyword arguments.

## 4. Refactoring (April 16, 2025)

Based on `docs/refactoring-proposal.md`, the codebase underwent significant restructuring:

* **Code Reorganization:**
  * Converted the single script into a Python package (`pybulkpdf`).
  * Created submodules: `core` (business logic), `utils` (helpers), `tests`.
  * Moved functionality into respective modules (`cli.py`, `config.py`, `exceptions.py`, `core/pdf_analyzer.py`, `core/template_generator.py`, `core/form_filler.py`, `utils/validation.py`, `utils/logging_setup.py`).
  * Established `__main__.py` as the entry point for `python -m pybulkpdf`.
* **Class-Based Design:**
  * Introduced `PDFAnalyzer` class to handle PDF reading and field analysis.
  * Introduced `TemplateGenerator` class to manage template file creation, using `PDFAnalyzer`.
  * Introduced `FormFiller` class to encapsulate the entire form-filling workflow (setup, row processing, PDF writing, summary).
  * Refactored procedural functions into methods within these classes.
* **Configuration Management:**
  * Created `pybulkpdf/config.py` to centralize constants (filenames, suffixes, field types, logging levels, etc.).
  * Updated core modules to import constants from `config.py`.
* **Custom Exceptions:**
  * Created `pybulkpdf/exceptions.py` defining a hierarchy of custom exceptions (`PyBulkPDFError`, `PDFReadError`, `PDFWriteError`, `ExcelReadError`, `ExcelWriteError`, `ConfigurationError`, `FileOperationError`).
  * Modified core modules and utilities to raise these specific exceptions on critical errors instead of using `sys.exit()` directly.
  * Updated top-level functions (`cli.py`, public functions in core modules) to catch these exceptions for graceful exit.
* **Unit Testing:**
  * Set up the `tests/` directory.
  * Added `pytest` and `pytest-mock` as testing dependencies.
  * Wrote unit tests for `utils.validation`, `core.pdf_analyzer`, `core.template_generator`, and `core.form_filler` using `pytest` and extensive mocking.
  * Iteratively debugged test setup issues related to environment, imports, and mocking.

## 5. Current Status

The refactoring process is complete. The application functions as before but with a significantly improved internal structure that is more maintainable, testable, and robust. All unit tests for the core refactored logic are passing. Next steps involve integration testing, packaging, and documentation updates.
