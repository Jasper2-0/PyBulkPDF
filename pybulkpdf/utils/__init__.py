"""
Initialization file for the PyBulkPDF utils package.

This file makes Python treat the 'utils' directory as a package,
allowing for relative imports within the PyBulkPDF project.
"""

# You can optionally import specific utility functions here
# to make them available directly under the 'utils' namespace, e.g.:
# from .logging_setup import setup_logging
# from .validation import check_file_exists, prepare_output_directory

# However, it's often cleaner to keep this file empty or minimal
# and use explicit imports like `from pybulkpdf.utils.logging_setup import setup_logging`.
