"""
Initialization file for the PyBulkPDF package.

This file makes Python treat the 'pybulkpdf' directory as the main package.
It can also be used to define package-level attributes like __version__.
"""

# Define package version (optional but recommended)
__version__ = "1.1.0" # Example version, update as needed

# You could potentially import key functions/classes here to make them
# available at the top level, e.g.:
# from .cli import main
# from .core.form_filler import FormFiller

# But often it's better to require users/developers to import from specific modules.
